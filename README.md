# OOP_University
Homework made for the OOP course in college


To run the program run the file AppCoordinator.cpp


Program functionalities:

1. Login. After successful authentication, all artists (name, date,location of the show,the number of seats available and the number of seats already sold)  are displayed, and all the movies( title, list of actors, date and place of screening, number of available seats and number of seats
already sold). An artist can support several shows, and a film can be projected many times

2. Operation:
- Search: After successful authentication, the person in the office can search for artists who
have a show or movies that run on a certain day. The application will display all artists
who have a show on that day, the location, the start time and the number of seats available,
as well as details about the movies projected that day.
- Purchase. The person at the office can sell tickets for a certain show or
movie. For the sale enter the name of the buyer and the number of seats desired.
After the sale you will be able to see the updated list of shows. If at a show
or movie there aren't any more seats, the show or movie will be displayed with special fonts.

3. Logout.

For special fonts I chose to use html, an html file will appear as a pop-up in which the data will be displayed in different colors and fonts (to vary the fonts I used a StyleSheet)
